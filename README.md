### About

I wanted to have some kind of alert system to be notified when the rate is at some certain value.

I am using Revolut data from https://revolut.com for this.

### Other sources

There are other sources to read rate.

- Revolut - free
- European Central Bank (ECB) - free
- http://free.currencyconverterapi.com - Probably has hit limit

### Technologies

I am using Next.js for this project.

### Endpoints

There are two endpoints for this project.

*http://localhost:3000/rates* which will only renders json content. However, due to NextJs, it is still a html page

*http://localhost:3000/* the same content, but this time with some nice look!
