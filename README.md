### About

I wanted to have some kind of alert system to be notified when the rate is at some certain value.

I am using Revolut data from https://revolut.com for this.

### Other sources

There are other sources to read rate.

- Google - free
- European Central Bank (ECB) - free
- http://free.currencyconverterapi.com - Probably has hit limit

### Technologies

I am using NextJs for this project.
